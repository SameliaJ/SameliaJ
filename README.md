## 📂 Featured Projects

### [Network Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/SameliaJ/data-science-tools-and-techniques)
Built a machine learning-based network security system using a Random Forest classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset. Deployed as a FastAPI web service with a web UI, automated tests, and CSV batch evaluation capabilities. This project demonstrates a practical ML deployment and a security application.

**Tech:** Python · Machine Learning · FastAPI · Network Security

### [Machine learning Amonia prediction project: A multi-farm prediction model](https://github.com/SameliaJ/impact-solutions)
Built a proof of concept with a team of students for an advisory tool for the Dutch dairy sector.
This project develops a Random Forest regression model to predict ammonia (NH₃) emissions from dairy farms based on management practices and farm characteristics. Using historical data from (2010-2024), the model identifies key emission drivers including nitrogen efficiency, protein in feed, and herd size, achieving strong predictive performance. 

**Tech:** Python · Machine Learning · 

### 📊 [Featured Project: Bean There Done That](https://github.com/SameliaJ/storytelling-with-data)

**Storytelling with Data**

Analyzed operational efficiency for a coffee roasting company, uncovering **74% untapped growth potential** through data-driven insights. Developed 5 custom KPIs revealing that coordination—not capacity—was the key constraint to scaling.
